I started learning Redux lately, it was pretty complex at first but once I started coding thing got clearer and clearer. Input Counter is a small application that I developed during my learning process that allows you to type a number in an input field than add that number to a counter. 
This is a Link to check the app (it's quite simple though) https://3k08h.csb.app/
